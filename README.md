This project aims to analyze Uber ride data to gain insights into rider patterns, driver behaviors, and overall trends in Uber usage. By analyzing this data, we aim to understand factors influencing ride requests, peak hours, popular routes, and more.

Data Sources
The analysis is based on a dataset obtained from Uber, containing information such as ride timestamps, pickup/dropoff locations, trip durations, and driver ratings. The dataset is anonymized to ensure privacy.

Analysis
The analysis uncovers trends and correlations within the data. We use descriptive statistics, data visualization, and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights.

Goals
Identify peak hours and popular locations for Uber rides.
Understand factors affecting rider satisfaction and driver ratings.
Explore potential correlations between weather conditions and ride demand.
Develop predictive models to forecast ride demand and optimize driver allocation.
